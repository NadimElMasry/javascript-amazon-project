This project recreates the Amazon website and is part of the full JavaScript course video by YouTuber SuperSimpleDev (SSD). It makes use of SSD's ready-made HTML structure (and CSS styling), and my job as a student of this course is to make it more interactive using JS. I plan on overhauling the website's appearance after I'm done with the JS scripting to make it look like something other than Amazon, just to practice my HTML/CSS skills, although I may dedicate a separate repository for that. The product objects on products.js were also entirely generated by SSD, and I don't plan on changing that in the foreseeable future.

I watched the entire second half of SSD's video, which he dedicated entirely for the Amazon project, without writing a single line of code myself. It was after I finished watching the course that I started recreating the website by solving each problem on my own as I rewatched the video part by part to make sure SSD's solutions and mine matched. I also learned several new concepts and methods along the way from various sources, which proved very useful and which weren't taught in SSD's course. I try to make my commit descriptions as detailed as possible to make it easier for anyone reading them to track the progress made in this project.
